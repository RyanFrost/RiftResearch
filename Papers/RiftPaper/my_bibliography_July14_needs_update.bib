The paper proposes force-field controller which can apply suitable forces on the leg to help it move on a desired trajectory. The interaction forces between the subject and the orthosis are designed to be 'assist-as-needed' for safe and effective gait training. Simulations and experimental results with the force-field controller are presented. Experiments have been performed with healthy subjects walking on a treadmill. It was shown that a healthy subject could be retrained in about 45 minutes with ALEX to walk on a treadmill with a significantly altered gait. In the coming months, this powered orthosis will be used for gait training of stroke patients.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND:
Understanding the extent of long-term neuropsychological deficits poststroke and their contribution to functional outcomes is essential for evidence-based rehabilitation and resource planning, and could improve stroke outcomes. However, most existing neuropsychological stroke data are not population-based, examine limited outcomes, and have short-term follow-up.

METHODS:
This population-based long-term stroke follow-up study examined associations between neuropsychological deficits (memory, executive function, information processing speed [IPS], visuoperceptual/construction ability, language), depression, and a range of functional outcomes and their interrelationships 5 years poststroke.

RESULTS:
The greatest proportion of the 307 participants exhibited neuropsychological functioning within the average range, and about 30%-50% performed at lower levels on most measures; few performed above the average range. Deficits were most common in executive functioning and IPS, and 30.4% of participants were depressed. While correlation analyses indicate all cognitive domains are significantly related to functional outcomes, multiple regression analyses showed that only IPS and visuoperceptual ability made significant independent contributions to functional outcomes over and above age, depression, and current Barthel Index. Depression also made a significant and independent contribution to functional outcomes.

CONCLUSION:
A considerable proportion of 5-year stroke survivors experience neuropsychological deficits, with these being more likely to involve IPS and executive functioning. Visuoperceptual/construction abilities, visual memory, and IPS were independently associated with handicap, disability, and health-related quality of life over and above contributions made by age, depression, and stroke severity, suggesting these areas are important targets for rehabilitation to improve overall stroke recovery and should be evaluated in future randomized controlled trials.},

  Abstract                 = {Locomotor patterns must be continuously adjusted to the immediate surrounds (e.g. uneven or slippery surface) and to changes in the body over time (e.g. growth and injury). In this thesis, I explored the neural mechanisms underlying adaptation of locomotion in humans. Adaptation was studied using a split-belt treadmill, where the two legs were constrained to separate belts moving at different or equal speeds. First, I investigated the extent to which walking in different directions can be adapted independently. It was surprising to discover that adaptation was direction-specific and did not transfer when the walking pattern 'simply' reversed. Moreover, adaptation was specific to a direction on each leg, rather than a specific set (i.e. forward-forward, forward-backward). Next, I found that adaptation transferred between different forms of forward locomotion (i.e. walk vs. run and level vs. incline walking). This finding is consistent with other studies suggesting that locomotor circuits are organized into "modules", some of which are shared across different forms of locomotion, and some are specialized. Finally, I studied split-belt walking in children with hemispherectomy (i.e. removal of one cerebral hemisphere). Adaptation of temporal, but not spatial, walking parameters were impaired in some hemispherectomy patients. This suggests that cerebral connections contribute to adaptation of timing in locomotion.},

- Each limb affects the strength of muscle activation of the other one.
- "All observations indicate that interlimb coordination during gait is hard-wired in some basic aspects of ipsilateral and contralateral leg muscle activation. Interlimb coordination is, however, flexible in so far that a quick automatic adaption to differences in speed is achieved. This indicates taht each leg is controlled by its own neuronal apparatus, which can be coupled in a variety of ways between the two legs. It is assumed that such a behavior is innate and based on interactions between peripheral sensors and sspinal interneuronal circuits."},

The patterns of sagittal lower limb joint kinematics and of muscle activation for a normal subject were similar when using the mechanized trainer and when walking on a treadmill. A non-ambulatory hemiparetic subject required little help from one therapist on the gait trainer, while two therapists were required to support treadmill walking. Gait movements on the trainer were highly symmetrical, impact free, and less spastic. The vertical displacement of the CoM was bi-phasic instead of mono-phasic during each gait cycle on the new device. Two cases of non-ambulatory patients, who regained their walking ability after 4 weeks of daily training on the gait trainer, are reported.},

A total of 63 participants <6 months poststroke with an initial walking speed between 0.1 to 0.6 m/s completed the multicenter, randomized clinical trial. All participants received twenty-four 1-hour sessions of either Lokomat or conventional gait training. Outcome measures were evaluated prior to training, after 12 and 24 sessions, and at a 3-month follow-up exam. Self-selected overground walking speed and distance walked in 6 minutes were the primary outcome measures, whereas secondary outcome measures included balance, mobility and function, cadence and symmetry, level of disability, and quality of life measures. Results. Participants who received conventional gait training experienced significantly greater gains in walking speed (P = .002) and distance (P = .03) than those trained on the Lokomat. These differences were maintained at the 3-month follow-up evaluation. Secondary measures were not different between the 2 groups, although a 2-fold greater improvement in cadence was observed in the conventional versus Lokomat group. Conclusions. For subacute stroke participants with moderate to severe gait impairments, the diversity of conventional gait training interventions appears to be more effective than robotic-assisted gait training for facilitating returns in walking ability.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND:
Locomotor training (LT) using a treadmill can improve walking ability over conventional rehabilitation in individuals with hemiparesis, although the personnel requirements often necessary to provide LT may limit its application. Robotic devices that provide consistent symmetrical assistance have been developed to facilitate LT, although their effectiveness in improving locomotor ability has not been well established.
METHODS:
Forty-eight ambulatory chronic stroke survivors stratified by severity of locomotor deficits completed a randomized controlled study on the effects of robotic- versus therapist-assisted LT. Both groups received 12 LT sessions for 30 minutes at similar speeds, with guided symmetrical locomotor assistance using a robotic orthosis versus manual facilitation from a single therapist using an assist-as-needed paradigm. Outcome measures included gait speed and symmetry, and clinical measures of activity and participation.
RESULTS:
Greater improvements in speed and single limb stance time on the impaired leg were observed in subjects who received therapist-assisted LT, with larger speed improvements in those with less severe gait deficits. Perceived rating of the effects of physical limitations on quality of life improved only in subjects with severe gait deficits who received therapist-assisted LT.
CONCLUSIONS:
Therapist-assisted LT facilitates greater improvements in walking ability in ambulatory stroke survivors as compared to a similar dosage of robotic-assisted LT.},

There is evidence to support rehabilitation in well coordinated multidisciplinary stroke units or through provision of early supported provision of discharge teams. Potentially beneficial treatment options for motor recovery of the arm include constraint-induced movement therapy and robotics. Promising interventions that could be beneficial to improve aspects of gait include fitness training, high-intensity therapy, and repetitive-task training. Repetitive-task training might also improve transfer functions. Occupational therapy can improve activities of daily living; however, information about the clinical effect of various strategies of cognitive rehabilitation and strategies for aphasia and dysarthria is scarce. Several large trials of rehabilitation practice and of novel therapies (eg, stem-cell therapy, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, virtual reality, robotic therapies, and drug augmentation) are underway to inform future practice.},

This prospective, blinded, randomized controlled study of gait retraining tested the feasibility and potential efficacy of using an electromechanical-driven gait orthosis (Lokomat) for treadmill training. Methods. Sixteen stroke patients, mostly within 3 months after onset, were randomized into 2 treatment groups, ABA or BAB (A = 3 weeks of Lokomat training, B = 3 weeks of conventional physical therapy) for 9 weeks of treatment. The outcome measures were the EU-Walking Scale, Rivermead Motor Assessment Scale, 10-m timed walking speed, 6-minute timed walking distance, Motricity Index, Medical Research Council Scale of strength, and Ashworth Scale of tone. Results. The EU-Walking Scale, Rivermead Motor Assessment Scale, 6-minute timed walking distance, Medical Research Council Scale, and Ashworth Scale demonstrated significantly more improvement during the Lokomat training phase than during the conventional physical therapy phase within each 3-week interval. Conclusions. Despite the small number of patients, the present data suggest that the Lokomat robotic assistive device provides innovative possibilities for gait training in stroke rehabilitation while eliminating prolonged repetitive movements in a nonergonomic position on the part of the physical therapist.},

Summary:
Authors' conclusions: 
People who receive electromechanical-assisted gait training in combination with physiotherapy after stroke are more likely to achieve independent walking than people who receive gait training without these devices. Specifically, people in the first three months after stroke and those who are not able to walk seem to benefit most from this type of intervention. The role of the type of device is still not clear. Further research should consist of a large definitive, pragmatic, phase III trial undertaken to address specific questions such as the following: What frequency or duration of electromechanical-assisted gait training might be most effective? How long does the benefit last?},

The device is designed to provide minimal constraints to the user's natural motion, and its actuated mobile base can move cooperatively with the user in any direction. Data from preliminary experiments performed by a healthy male subject confirm that the reactive control system can compensate for the device's inertial effects and that the device's omnidirectional mobile base reduces pelvis and torso motion constraints. The results also demonstrate that GaitEnable can easily be programmed to simulate different types of behaviours or motion constraints.},

  Abstract                 = {The KineAssist is a robotic device for gait and balance training. A user-needs analysis led us to focus on increasing the level of challenge to a patient's ability to maintain balance during gait training, and also on maintaining direct involvement of a physical therapist (rather than attempting robotic replacement.) The KineAssist provides partial body weight support and postural torques on the torso; allows many axes of motion of the trunk as well as of the pelvis; leaves the patient's legs accessible to a physical therapist during walking; servo-follows a patient's walking motions overground in forward, rotation, and sidestepping directions; and catches a patient who begins to fall. Design and development of the KineAssist proceeded more rapidly in the context of a small company than would have been possible in most research contexts. A prototype KineAssist has been constructed, and has received FDA approval and IRB clearance for initial human studies. We describe the KineAssist's motivation, design, and use.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE:
To evaluate the effect of repetitive locomotor training on an electromechanical gait trainer plus physiotherapy in subacute stroke patients.
DESIGN:
Randomized controlled trial.
SETTING:
Four German neurological rehabilitation centres.
SUBJECTS:
One hundred and fifty-five non-ambulatory patients (first-time stroke <60 days).
INTERVENTION:
Group A received 20 min locomotor training and 25 min physiotherapy; group B had 45 min physiotherapy every week day for four weeks.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:
Primary variables were gait ability (Functional Ambulation Category, 0-5) and the Barthel Index (0-100), blindly assessed at study onset, end, and six months later for follow-up. Responders to the therapy had to become ambulatory (Functional Ambulation Category 4 or 5) or reach a Barthel Index of > or = 75. Secondary variables were walking velocity, endurance, mobility and leg power.
RESULTS:
The intention-to-treat analysis revealed that significantly greater number of patients in group A could walk independently: 41 of 77 versus 17 of 78 in group B (P B < 0.0001) at treatment end. Also, significantly more group A patients had reached a Barthel Index > or = 75: 44 of 77 versus 21 of 78 (P B < 0.0001). At six-month follow-up, the superior gait ability in group A persisted (54 of 77 versus 28 of 78, P B < 0.0001), while the Barthel Index responder rate did not differ. For all secondary variables, group A patients had improved significantly more (P B < 0.0001) during the treatment period, but not during follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS:
Intensive locomotor training plus physiotherapy resulted in a significantly better gait ability and daily living competence in subacute stroke patients compared with physiotherapy alone.},

  Abstract                 = {Caregiver burden following stroke is increasingly recognised as a significant health care concern. A growing number of studies have evaluated the patient, caregiver, and social support factors that contribute to increased caregiver burden. We conducted a systematic review of this literature to guide future research. A search of the MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and EMBASE databases (up to July 2008) and reference sections of published studies using a structured search strategy yielded 24 relevant articles. Studies were included if they evaluated predictors and/or correlates of caregiver burden in the setting of stroke. The prevalence of caregiver burden was 25-54% and remained elevated for an indefinite period following stroke. In studies that evaluated independent baseline predictors of subsequent caregiver burden, none of the factors reported were consistent across studies. In studies that assessed concurrent factors independently contributing to caregiver burden in the poststroke period, patient characteristics and social support factors were inconsistently reported. Several studies identified caregiver mental health and the amount of time and effort required of the caregiver as significant determinants of caregiver burden. Our findings highlight the need for more research to identify caregivers in need of support and guide the development and implementation of appropriate interventions to offset caregiver burden.},

Evidence for length senstive feedback being important in human walking. Supporting arguments are (1) the change in muscle activity paralleled change in muscle length as opposed to changes in load on muscles and (2) change in muscle activity still occured with ischemia which blocks large-diameter group I afferents (load) but leaves transmission of smaller diameter afferent like group II (length). Also, they blocked cutaneous feedback.
